                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p><strong>Forward Head Posture</strong> is common among those who are spending many hours sitting in front of a desk, 
                    like students and office workers, which can result in having bad posture everywhere else including, 
                    but not limited to, driving and walking. Prolonged bad posture can cause <em>kyphosis</em>, an exaggerated 
                    forward rounding of the upper back, in severe cases.</p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>Our solution is to create a reminder for the target audience to fix their posture whenever they veer from proper posture.</p>
